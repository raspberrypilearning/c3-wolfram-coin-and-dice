## Challenge: impossible dice

To make dice out of physical materials, the dice need to be designed so that when the user rolls them, they have an equal chance of landing on each side. This means that some dice cannot be made, because the number of sides that they would have do not fit a shape that could be rolled evenly. In Wolfram, this is not a problem, and you can make dice with as many sides as you like. Try making a few, like five- or seven-sided dice.
